## [1] Statistical Methods
	
	__Descriptive__: describe key features of a data set
	
	__Inferential__: draw conclusions about the population based on sample data.
		
		-- Where a population refers to an ideal or theoretical group
			 that would be too costly to adequately measure.
	
	__Statistic__: a descriptive measure computed from the data of a sample.

	__Parameter__: a descriptive measure computed form the data of a population.

|Measurement | Population Parameter | Sample Statistic |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|mean | $$\mu$$ | $$\bar{x}$$ |
|proportion | p | $$\hat{p}$$ |
|variance | $$\sigma^{2}$$ | $$s^2$$ |
|correlation coefficient | $$\rho$$ | r |

## [2] Sampling Methods and Techniques

	__Random Sample__: a sample of *n* measurements selected from
		a population is random if every different sample of size
		*n* has an equal probability of being selected.

	__Simple Random Sampling__: each individual within a sample is chosen at
		random and each member of the population has an equal probability
		of being included in the sample.

	__Systematic Sampling__: selection of elements from an ordered sampling frame.
		The selection starts by taking an element at random followed by 
		every $$k^{th}$$ element, where:
		$$ K = (\frac{N}{n})

	__Stratified Sampling__: There may often be factors that divide of partition the 
		population into subpopulations (i.e. groups/strata), and we may reasonably
		expect the measurement of interest to vary among them. The strata must therefore
		be disjoint in order to reduce sampling variability.

## [Measurents of Central Tendency]
	
	__mean__: the average of *n* values of data.
	$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\left (\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\right ) = \frac{x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_n}{n}$$

	__median__: the central value of an ordered dataset, more robust than the mean to outliers.


	__mode__: the most frequent data entry in a set. Can have no more, unimodal or bimodal.
