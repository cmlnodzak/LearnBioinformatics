Welcome to my bioinformatics and computational biology blog! </br>
It's a work in progress at the moment, but in due time I hope </br>
to have uploaded my notes and explanations for various bioinformatics </br>
topics that I've picked up as I've progressed through my PhD. </br>
It's my hope that this project will help budding scientists learn more </br>
about the field in an approachable way.
